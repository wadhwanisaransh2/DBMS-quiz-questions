1. What does the ER Model represent in database design?

    Physical structure

    Data relationships and structure

    Programming logic

    User interface

Correct Answer: Data relationships and structure

Explanation: The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a high-level conceptual data model that represents the data as a collection of entities, attributes, and relationships. It is used to design the logical structure of a database, focusing on how different data points are connected.

2. What kind of entity can exist independently?

    Weak Entity

    Strong Entity

    Partial Entity

    Associated Entity

Correct Answer: Strong Entity

Explanation: A strong entity is an entity that can be uniquely identified by its own attributes and does not depend on another entity for its existence. It has a primary key. A weak entity, conversely, depends on a strong entity for its identification.

3. Which key is used to uniquely identify an entity instance?
    Composite Key
    Secondary Key
    Primary Key
    Foreign Key

Correct Answer: Primary Key

Explanation: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain a unique value for each row and cannot contain null values. It is the fundamental key for uniquely identifying an entity instance.

4. What is the difference between a tangible and intangible entity?
    Tangible entities are stored; intangible are not
    Tangible entities are real-world objects; intangible entities are abstract concepts
    There is no difference
    Tangible entities have no attributes

Correct Answer: Tangible entities are real-world objects; intangible entities are abstract concepts

Explanation: Tangible entities are physical objects you can touch, like a person or a car. Intangible entities are abstract concepts or events, like a job, a sale, or a class.

5. What is a composite attribute?
    An attribute with a NULL value
    An attribute that is stored in the database
    An attribute that can be divided into smaller sub-parts
    An attribute with multiple values

Correct Answer: An attribute that can be divided into smaller sub-parts

Explanation: A composite attribute is an attribute that is composed of several other attributes. For example, the Address attribute can be divided into Street, City, State, and Zip Code.
to smaller sub-parts


6. What shape represents derived attributes in an ER diagram?
    Solid oval
    Dotted oval
    Rectangle
    Triangle

Correct Answer: Dotted oval

Explanation: In an ER diagram, derived attributes are represented by a dotted oval. A derived attribute is an attribute whose value can be calculated or derived from other attributes, like calculating Age from a Date of Birth.


7. What does "IS-A" relationship denote in EER?
    Aggregation
    Specialization
    Categorization
    Union

Correct Answer: Specialization

Explanation: The "IS-A" relationship denotes specialization, a top-down approach in which an entity is divided into sub-entities. For example, a PERSON is-a STUDENT or a PERSON is-a INSTRUCTOR.


8. 8. Which of the following best describes generalization?
    Dividing an entity into multiple entities
    Combining similar entities into a single general entity
    Inheriting attributes from multiple superclasses
    Adding new attributes to an entity

Correct Answer: Combining similar entities into a single general entity

Explanation: Generalization is a bottom-up approach in which two or more lower-level entities with some common attributes are combined to form a higher-level general entity. For example, CAR, TRUCK, and MOTORCYCLE can be generalized into a VEHICLE.


9. What type of constraint requires every superclass instance to be a member of a subclass?

    Partial constraint
    Disjoint constraint
    Total constraint
    Overlap constraint
Correct Answer: Total constraint

Explanation: A total constraint requires that every entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass. This is represented by a double line connecting the superclass to the circle in an EER diagram.


10. What does a union type in EER represent?
    A weak entity
    A single attribute
    A category that represents a union of multiple entity types
    A derived attribute

Correct Answer: A category that represents a union of multiple entity types

Explanation: A union type (also known as a category) is a specialized concept in the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model. It allows a single entity type to be a union of two or more distinct entity types, where these entity types may have different attributes. For example, a VEHICLE_OWNER can be a PERSON or a COMPANY.
