1. What does the ER Model represent in database design?
    Physical structure
    Data relationships and structure
    Programming logic
    User interface

Correct Answer: Data relationships and structure

Explanation: The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a high-level conceptual data model that represents the data as a collection of entities, attributes, and relationships. It is used to design the logical structure of a database, focusing on how different data points are connected.

2. What kind of entity can exist independently?
    Weak Entity
    Strong Entity
    Partial Entity
    Associated Entity

Correct Answer: Strong Entity

Explanation: A strong entity is an entity that can be uniquely identified by its own attributes and does not depend on another entity for its existence. It has a primary key. A weak entity, conversely, depends on a strong entity for its identification.

3. Which key is used to uniquely identify an entity instance?
    Composite Key
    Secondary Key
    Primary Key
    Foreign Key

Correct Answer: Primary Key

Explanation: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain a unique value for each row and cannot contain null values. It is the fundamental key for uniquely identifying an entity instance.

4. What is the difference between a tangible and intangible entity?
    Tangible entities are stored; intangible are not
    Tangible entities are real-world objects; intangible entities are abstract concepts
    There is no difference
    Tangible entities have no attributes

Correct Answer: Tangible entities are real-world objects; intangible entities are abstract concepts

Explanation: Tangible entities are physical objects you can touch, like a person or a car. Intangible entities are abstract concepts or events, like a job, a sale, or a class.

5. What is a composite attribute?
    An attribute with a NULL value
    An attribute that is stored in the database
    An attribute that can be divided into smaller sub-parts
    An attribute with multiple values

Correct Answer: An attribute that can be divided into smaller sub-parts

Explanation: A composite attribute is an attribute that is composed of several other attributes. For example, the Address attribute can be divided into Street, City, State, and Zip Code.

6. What shape represents derived attributes in an ER diagram?
    Solid oval
    Dotted oval
    Rectangle
    Triangle

Correct Answer: Dotted oval

Explanation: In an ER diagram, derived attributes are represented by a dotted oval. A derived attribute is an attribute whose value can be calculated or derived from other attributes, like calculating Age from a Date of Birth.
