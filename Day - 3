1. Which database type is specifically designed for high-speed access using simple keys and values, often used for caching?

    Columnar Database
    Document Database
    Key-Value Store
    Relational Database

Correct Answer: Key-Value Store

Explanation: Key-Value stores, such as Redis and DynamoDB, offer extremely fast lookups because they store data as a collection of key-value pairs. This simple structure makes them ideal for caching, session management, and other use cases requiring quick data retrieval.

2. What does horizontal scalability mean in the context of database systems?

    Adding more CPUs to the same server
    Rewriting database queries for optimization
    Distributing data across multiple servers
    Using multiple databases with one schema

Correct Answer: Distributing data across multiple servers

Explanation: Horizontal scalability involves scaling out by adding more machines to a system. This approach distributes the workload across multiple servers, a common practice in NoSQL systems to handle large amounts of data and traffic. In contrast, vertical scalability involves adding more power (like CPUs or RAM) to a single machine.
