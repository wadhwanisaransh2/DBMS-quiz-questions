1. Which database type is specifically designed for high-speed access using simple keys and values, often used for caching?

    Columnar Database
    Document Database
    Key-Value Store
    Relational Database

Correct Answer: Key-Value Store

Explanation: Key-Value stores, such as Redis and DynamoDB, offer extremely fast lookups because they store data as a collection of key-value pairs. This simple structure makes them ideal for caching, session management, and other use cases requiring quick data retrieval.

2. What does horizontal scalability mean in the context of database systems?

    Adding more CPUs to the same server
    Rewriting database queries for optimization
    Distributing data across multiple servers
    Using multiple databases with one schema

Correct Answer: Distributing data across multiple servers

Explanation: Horizontal scalability involves scaling out by adding more machines to a system. This approach distributes the workload across multiple servers, a common practice in NoSQL systems to handle large amounts of data and traffic. In contrast, vertical scalability involves adding more power (like CPUs or RAM) to a single machine.


3. Which type of database is best suited for applications requiring strict ACID compliance and complex joins?

    Key-Value Store
    Document Database
    Relational Database
    Time Series Database
Correct Answer: Relational Database

Explanation: Relational databases (RDBMS) are the most suitable choice for applications that need strict ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Their structured, tabular format also makes them highly effective at handling complex queries with multiple joins.


4. If your application deals with metrics, logs, or time-stamped sensor data, which type of database is most appropriate?

    Document Database
    Columnar Database
    Relational Database
    Time Series Database

Correct Answer: Time Series Database

Explanation: Time Series Databases are specifically optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, such as performance metrics, server logs, and IoT sensor data. They are designed for fast ingestion and efficient analysis of data that arrives in a time-ordered sequence.
