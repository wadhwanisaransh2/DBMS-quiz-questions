1. What is the purpose of the MERGE command in SQL?
    Select all records
    Drop the table
    Perform insert or update in one step
    Grant permissions
Correct Answer: Perform insert or update in one step
Explanation: The MERGE command is used to combine INSERT and UPDATE operations into a single statement. It's often used when synchronizing data between a source table and a target table.


2. Which type of DBMS is best suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data like JSON documents?
    Relational DBMS (RDBMS)
    Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)
    NoSQL DBMS
    Hierarchical DBMS
Correct Answer: NoSQL DBMS
Explanation: NoSQL databases are specifically designed for flexible data models, making them ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data formats like JSON, key-value pairs, or graph-based data, unlike the rigid, tabular structures of Relational DBMS.


3. Which DCL command is used to grant specific database access permissions to a user?
    COMMIT
    GRANT
    SELECT
    UPDATE
Correct Answer: GRANT

Explanation: The GRANT command is a Data Control Language (DCL) command used to provide specific privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) to a user or role. COMMIT is a Transaction Control Language (TCL) command, while SELECT and UPDATE are Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands.


4. In the database approach, data is stored in a
    Text File
    Spreadsheet
    Database specific format
    Word processor
Correct Answer: Database specific format

Explanation: Unlike traditional file systems, a Database Management System (DBMS) stores data centrally in its own specific format to ensure efficiency, data integrity, and consistency. This format is managed and controlled by the DBMS software.


5. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the database approach?
    Self-describing nature of a database
    Insulation between programs and data
    Multiple views of data
    Increased data redundancy
Correct Answer: Increased data redundancy

Explanation: One of the primary goals of a DBMS is to reduce data redundancy by storing data in a single, centralized location and enforcing integrity rules. The database approach aims to decrease, not increase, data duplication.


6. What is data independence?
    Data not accessible to anyone
    Data can be used without backup
    Changes in data do not affect application programs
    Data is dependent on one user
Correct Answer: Changes in data do not affect application programs

Explanation: Data independence is a major advantage of a DBMS. It means that the data structure can be changed without requiring changes to the application programs that use the data. This provides flexibility and makes maintenance easier.


7. Which of the following is an advantage of using a DBMS?
    Increased redundancy
    Better data integration
    More complex programming
    Less security
Correct Answer: Better data integration

Explanation: A key benefit of a DBMS is that it provides a central repository for data, allowing for the integration of data from various sources. This helps to manage and analyze information consistently across an organization.


8. Which one of the following is a disadvantage of a DBMS?
    Improved data consistency
    Data sharing
    High initial cost
    Reduced redundancy
Correct Answer: High initial cost

Explanation: While a DBMS offers many benefits, it often involves a significant upfront investment in software, hardware, and training. This can be a major drawback for smaller organizations or projects with limited budgets.


9. In a DBMS, multiple users can access data at the same time. This requires a DBMS to support?
    Single-user mode
    Concurrency control
    Multi-mode access
    Parallel retrieval
Correct Answer: Concurrency control

Explanation: Concurrency control is a fundamental feature of a DBMS. It ensures that when multiple users or applications access and modify the same data simultaneously, their operations do not interfere with each other, maintaining data integrity and consistency.


10. Which of the following is a component of a DBMS?
    Compiler
    Query Processor
    Spreadsheet
    Web Browser
Correct Answer: Query Processor

Explanation: A Query Processor is a core component of a DBMS. It's responsible for interpreting and executing database queries, often written in SQL, enabling users to interact with the database and retrieve information efficiently.
