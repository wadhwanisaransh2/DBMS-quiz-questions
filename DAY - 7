1. What is the purpose of introducing Generalization, Specialization, and Aggregation in ER modeling?

    To increase database complexity

    To store more data types

    To support abstraction and manage complex data

    To convert ER model into relational model

Correct Answer: To support abstraction and manage complex data

Explanation: Generalization, Specialization, and Aggregation are all concepts in the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model. Their primary purpose is to help in modeling complex, real-world data more accurately and to introduce levels of abstraction, making the database design easier to understand and manage.

2. Generalization is a:

    Top-down approach

    Bottom-up approach

    Parallel approach

    Side-by-side approach

Correct Answer: Bottom-up approach

Explanation: Generalization is a bottom-up process. It involves combining multiple lower-level entities with common attributes into a single higher-level entity type. For example, CAR and TRUCK can be generalized into a VEHICLE entity.
