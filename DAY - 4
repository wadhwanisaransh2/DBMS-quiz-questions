Question 1
What is the main purpose of the MERGE command in SQL?
    Select all records
    Drop the table
    Perform insert or update in one step
    Grant permissions
Correct Answer: Perform insert or update in one step

Explanation: The MERGE statement is a powerful SQL command that allows you to perform conditional INSERT or UPDATE operations on a target table based on the existence of matching rows in a source table. This is often more efficient than writing separate INSERT and UPDATE statements.

Question 2
Which of the following commands modifies an existing structure of a table?
    CREATE
    ALTER
    DROP
    MERGE
Correct Answer: ALTER

Explanation: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing table. This includes adding, modifying, or dropping columns; and adding or dropping constraints.

Question 3
What does the ROLLBACK command do in SQL?
    Saves all the changes
    Deletes the entire table
    Undoes changes made since last commit
    Grants permissions
Correct Answer: Undoes changes made since last commit

Explanation: The ROLLBACK command is a Transaction Control Language (TCL) command. It is used to undo all the changes in the current transaction, which is everything that has happened since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command.

Question 4

Which of the following is a system privilege in DBMS?
    SELECT on a table
    INSERT on a table
    DELETE a specific row from a table
    CREATE TABLE
Correct Answer: CREATE TABLE

Explanation: System privileges grant a user the right to perform a specific action within the database system itself, like creating a table (CREATE TABLE), a user, or a role. Object privileges, on the other hand, grant permissions on a specific database object, such as a table (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

   
Question 5
What is the purpose of authorization in DBMS?
    Encrypting the database
    Backing up data
    Granting permission to access specific database objects
    Recovering lost transactions
Correct Answer: Granting permission to access specific database objects

Explanation: Authorization in a Database Management System (DBMS) is the process of granting or denying a user permission to perform specific actions on specific data or objects, like a table or a view. It defines what a user is allowed to do.
