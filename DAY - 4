What is the main purpose of the MERGE command in SQL?
    Select all records
    Drop the table
    Perform insert or update in one step
    Grant permissions
Correct Answer: Perform insert or update in one step

Explanation: The MERGE statement is a powerful SQL command that allows you to perform conditional INSERT or UPDATE operations on a target table based on the existence of matching rows in a source table. This is often more efficient than writing separate INSERT and UPDATE statements.
