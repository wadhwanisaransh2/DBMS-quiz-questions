1. Which of the following uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation?
Super Key

Candidate Key

Primary Key

Foreign Key

Correct Answer: Primary Key

Explanation: The Primary Key is a specific type of candidate key chosen to uniquely identify each tuple (row) in a table. While a Super Key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple, and a Candidate Key is a minimal super key, the primary key is the one designated for unique identification.


2. What does Cardinality of a relation refer to?
Number of attributes

Number of relations

Number of keys

Number of tuples

Correct Answer: Number of tuples

Explanation: The cardinality of a relation (table) is the number of tuples (rows) it contains. The number of attributes (columns) is referred to as the degree of the relation.


3. Which key can have NULL values?
Primary Key

Candidate Key

Super Key

Foreign Key

Correct Answer: Foreign Key

Explanation: A Foreign Key can have a NULL value, meaning that the record is not related to any record in the referenced table. Primary keys, candidate keys, and super keys are all required to be unique and cannot be NULL.


4. What does Referential Integrity ensure?
All data in a column is unique

Every table has a primary key

Foreign key values match primary keys in the referenced table

No attribute has NULL value

Correct Answer: Foreign key values match primary keys in the referenced table

Explanation: Referential Integrity is a database concept that ensures that relationships between tables are consistent. It is enforced by a foreign key, which links to the primary key of another table, guaranteeing that a record in the referencing table always has a corresponding record in the referenced table.


5. What is a tuple in a DBMS?
A column in a table

A database schema

A single row or record in a table

A type of query

Correct Answer: A single row or record in a table

Explanation: In the context of a relational database, a tuple is the formal term for a single row or record in a table.


6. In a relational database, what does each column in a tuple represent?
A row

A primary key

An attribute or field

A tuple

Correct Answer: An attribute or field

Explanation: Each column in a relational table represents an attribute or a field. An attribute defines a characteristic of the entity that the table represents. For example, in a Student table, StudentID, Name, and Age would be attributes.


7. How are tuples used in normalization?
To delete data

To increase redundancy

To organize data and reduce redundancy

To replicate data

Correct Answer: To organize data and reduce redundancy

Explanation: Normalization is a process used to organize tables and columns in a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to ensure that each tuple (row) represents a single, well-defined entity.


8. What does a query return in a relational database?
Columns only

Tables only

A set of tuples that match criteria

Attributes only

Correct Answer: A set of tuples that match criteria

Explanation: A database query (e.g., a SELECT statement) returns a set of tuples (rows) that satisfy the specified conditions or criteria.


9. What is the role of a Logical Tuple in DBMS?
Stores backup data

Temporarily represents data in memory

Creates the schema

Deletes duplicate data

Correct Answer: Temporarily represents data in memory

Explanation: A logical tuple is an in-memory representation of data, which may be created for a specific task like processing a query or performing an operation. It's a temporary structure used during database operations.


10. In the CUSTOMER table, which of the following is most likely a tuple?
customer_id

first_name

1, John, Smith, abc@gmail.com

email

Correct Answer: 1, John, Smith, abc@gmail.com

Explanation: A tuple is a single row of data in a table. In the provided options, 1, John, Smith, abc@gmail.com represents a complete record for a single customer, which is a tuple. The other options are individual attributes or field names.
