1. What is the main purpose of keys in a DBMS?
Correct Answer: To uniquely identify records and maintain data integrity

Explanation: The primary purpose of keys (like primary keys and foreign keys) is to uniquely identify records within a table and to establish relationships between tables. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency throughout the database.


2. Which of the following can be classified as a super key?
Correct Answer: STUD_NO + SNAME

Explanation: A super key is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. In this case, combining a student number (STUD_NO) with a student name (SNAME) creates a super key. A single attribute like STUD_NO could also be a super key if it is unique. However, STUD_NO combined with SNAME is a classic example of a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record, making it a super key.


3. What makes a candidate key different from a super key?
Correct Answer: It is a minimal super key with no unnecessary attributes

Explanation: A candidate key is a minimal super key. This means it is a super key from which no attributes can be removed without losing the uniqueness property. For example, {SSN} might be a candidate key, but {SSN, Name} is a super key that is not a candidate key because Name is an unnecessary attribute for unique identification.

4. Which of the following cannot be NULL?
Correct Answer: Primary key

Explanation: A primary key is an attribute (or a set of attributes) that uniquely identifies a row in a table. By definition, a primary key cannot contain a NULL value. This is because a NULL value would mean the record cannot be uniquely identified, which violates the purpose of the primary key.


5. Which of the following is NOT an integrity constraint in DBMS?
Correct Answer: Behavioral Constraint

Explanation: In a DBMS, integrity constraints are rules that prevent invalid data from being entered into a database. The most common types are Domain Constraints (ensuring data types are correct), Key Constraints (ensuring keys are unique), and Referential Integrity (ensuring foreign keys are valid). A Behavioral Constraint is not a standard term for an integrity constraint in database theory.


6. Which of the following constraints ensures that no two rows have the same value in a specified column or columns?
Correct Answer: Key Constraint

Explanation: A Key Constraint ensures that the value in a specified column or a set of columns is unique for each row. The Primary Key Constraint and Unique Key Constraint are specific types of key constraints used to enforce this rule.


7. Which of the following constraints can be used to define rules that involve multiple tables or complex conditions?
Correct Answer: Assertion

Explanation: An Assertion is a statement that tests for a condition that should be satisfied by the database. It is a more powerful form of a constraint that can involve multiple tables or complex conditions. While Triggers can also enforce complex rules, they are a procedural mechanism that executes a set of actions in response to a specific event, whereas an Assertion is a declarative statement that is constantly checked by the system.


8. Referential integrity ensures that a foreign key:
Correct Answer: Must either match a primary key or be NULL

Explanation: Referential integrity requires that a value in a foreign key column of one table must either match a value in the primary key of the referenced table or be NULL. This rule prevents the creation of "orphaned" records that point to a non-existent primary key.
