1. What is a schema in a database?
    A type of data encryption
    A graphical report
    A structure that defines how data is organized in a database
    A backup file of the database

Correct Answer: A structure that defines how data is organized in a database

Explanation: A database schema defines the logical structure of a database, including the tables, fields, relationships, indexes, and views. It's the blueprint that organizes the data.


2. Which of the following related to snowflake schema is true?
    Each dimension is represented by a single dimensional table
    Maintenance efforts are less
    Dimension tables are normalised
    It is not an extension of star schema

Correct Answer: Dimension tables are normalised

Explanation: In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, unlike a star schema where they are denormalized into a single table. This normalization reduces data redundancy but increases the complexity of queries and maintenance.


3. In which DBMS architecture does the user directly interact with the database?
    1-tier
    2-tier
    3-tier
    4-tier
Correct Answer: 1-tier

Explanation: In a 1-tier architecture, the user, application, and database are all on the same machine. The user interacts directly with the database, which is often used for local development or simple applications.


4. Which architecture separates the application and database with a client-server model?

    1-tier
    2-tier
    3-tier
    Multi-tier
Correct Answer: 2-tier

Explanation: A 2-tier architecture separates the application (client) and the database (server). The client application sends requests directly to the database server, and the database server responds with the requested data.


5. In 3-tier architecture, which tier is responsible for business logic?
    Presentation Tier
    Data Tier
    Application Tier
    Network Tier
Correct Answer: Application Tier

Explanation: The Application Tier (also known as the middle tier) in a 3-tier architecture is responsible for handling the business logic. It processes the user's request, communicates with the data tier, and sends the processed data back to the presentation tier.


6. What is an instance of a database?
    Physical location of DBMS
    Logical structure of data
    Actual data stored in the database at a given time
    A stored procedure

Correct Answer: Actual data stored in the database at a given time

Explanation: A database instance refers to the actual content or data stored in the database at a specific moment. This is a dynamic state that changes as data is added, modified, or deleted.


7. In DBMS architecture, what is the main role of the presentation tier?

    Execute queries
    Store data
    Display user interface
    Manage database transactions
Correct Answer: Display user interface

Explanation: The presentation tier is the top-most layer in a multi-tier architecture. Its primary role is to display the user interface and handle user interaction.
