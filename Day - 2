2. Which of the following related to snowflake schema is true?
    Each dimension is represented by a single dimensional table
    Maintenance efforts are less
    Dimension tables are normalised
    It is not an extension of star schema

Correct Answer: Dimension tables are normalised

Explanation: In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, unlike a star schema where they are denormalized into a single table. This normalization reduces data redundancy but increases the complexity of queries and maintenance.


3. In which DBMS architecture does the user directly interact with the database?
    1-tier
    2-tier
    3-tier
    4-tier
Correct Answer: 1-tier
